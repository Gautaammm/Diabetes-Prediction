# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
- **Author:** Goutham Kumar Aare
- **Project:** Determining the Likelihood of Diabetes in Individuals

## Project Description
In this project, we aim to predict whether an individual might have diabetes using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data exploration, model building, and evaluation.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndasilva/diabetes).
